      Yesterday I made my first maker's mark! :D My general concept of a maker's mark is a mark that I put on all my creations including UI software and 3D prints. My maker's mark design was inspired by the minimalist designs of medieval
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mason%27s_mark">mason's marks</a> which were used to signify which mason created which stonework in buildings to determine sallery and to self advertise.
